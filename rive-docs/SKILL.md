# 1. INTRODUCTION & GETTING STARTED

Source: https://rive.app/docs/getting-started/introduction

## Welcome to Rive

Welcome to the Rive Docs. We've split this documentation into the sub-sections below. If you can't find the information you're looking for or have questions for us, join us on Twitter, Discord, or contact us by filling out this form.

## Quick Start Tips

- Create an account and try out the Rive Editor
- Design and animate using the Rive docs or watch tutorial videos in Rive 101
- Jump into adding Rive to apps and games via app runtimes and game runtime docs
- Explore use cases with examples, blogs, and tutorials

## Explore Rive - Three Main Paths

### 1. Interface Overview
Start designing and animating in Rive. The editor enables creation, animation design, and state machine logic before exporting via runtimes.

### 2. App Runtimes
Open-source libraries for real-time rendering across Web, iOS, Android, Flutter, React Native, and more.

### 3. Game Runtimes
Open-source libraries for real-time rendering in Unity, Unreal, and Defold with custom engine integration.

# 2. EDITOR INTERFACE OVERVIEW

Source: https://rive.app/docs/editor/interface-overview/overview

## Main Panels

Rive's interface is organized into main panels, showing only what's needed when it's needed.

### Toolbar
The toolbar displays available tools for creating, rigging, and manipulating stage items. It includes options to customize file appearance, set the main artboard, and export or share files.

**More info:** [Toolbar](/docs/editor/interface-overview/toolbar)

### Hierarchy
All objects, assets, controls, and animations comprising a file appear here. The hierarchy also contains the Assets Panel and Data Panel.

**More info:** [Hierarchy](/docs/editor/interface-overview/hierarchy)

### Inspector
Allows adjustment of properties for selected objects—whether on the stage, timeline, or state machine. Properties change dynamically based on context.

**More info:** [Inspector](/docs/editor/interface-overview/inspector)

### Stage
The central canvas area bounded by the Toolbar, Hierarchy, and Inspector. This is where artboards are created as design and animation foundations.

**More info:** [Stage](/docs/editor/interface-overview/stage)

### Timeline
Appears at the bottom when entering animate mode. Enables creating states, accessing playback controls, and setting keyframes. Select timelines from the left-hand list to switch between animations for the active artboard.

**More info:** [Timeline](/docs/editor/animate-mode/timeline)

### State Machine Graph
Replaces the timeline when a state machine is selected, providing the workspace for state machine development.

**More info:** [State Machine](/docs/editor/state-machine/state-machine)

# 3. SCRIPTING

Source: https://rive.app/docs/scripting/getting-started

## Overview

"Code, animation, and interaction all in one Editor." Scripting enables developers to combine code, design, and animation within a unified collaborative environment.

## Why Luau?

Rive uses Luau as its scripting language. Luau is a fast, small, safe, gradually typed embeddable scripting language derived from Lua.

## Key Topics

### Creating Scripts
Instructions for initiating new scripts in Rive.
**More info:** [Creating Scripts](/docs/scripting/creating-scripts)

### Protocols
Available script types and their purposes.
**More info:** [Protocols Overview](/docs/scripting/protocols)

### Inputs
Connecting scripts to inputs and data sources.
**More info:** [Script Inputs](/docs/scripting/script-inputs)

### Debugging
Tools for troubleshooting scripts.
**More info:** [Debug Panel](/docs/scripting/debugging/debug-panel)

### AI Agent
Using AI to generate and modify scripts.
**More info:** [Editor AI Agent](/docs/editor/ai-agent)

## Official Runtime GitHub Repositories

- **Web**: https://github.com/rive-app/rive-wasm
- **React**: https://github.com/rive-app/rive-react
- **Apple (iOS)**: https://github.com/rive-app/rive-ios
- **Android**: https://github.com/rive-app/rive-android
- **Flutter**: https://github.com/rive-app/rive-flutter
- **C++**: https://github.com/rive-app/rive-cpp
- **React Native**: https://github.com/rive-app/rive-react-native

## Handling .riv Files in Git

When version controlling `.riv` files with Git, add a `.gitattributes` file:

```
*.riv binary
```

This prevents line-ending corruption across platforms (CRLF vs LF).

## Licensing

All official runtimes are open-source and licensed under the MIT License. Free for personal and commercial applications.
